## Project Description
On Average, a person has at least 7 different accounts he or she has signed in to, be it email, social media, entertainment or job portal accounts among others. It therefore becomes quite tasking for a user to remember all these passwords. This project handles this challenge by helping users
manage the passwords of their various accounts and also generates new passwords for them when creating new accounts.
